 # TokenVesting Project Summary

This project implements a flexible token vesting system on Ethereum/EVM blockchains, designed to manage token vesting schedules for projects, teams, investors, and other stakeholders.

## Core Components

### TokenVestingFactory

A factory contract that deploys and manages vesting locks using the minimal proxy pattern (EIP-1167) for gas efficiency. The factory:

- Creates new vesting lock contracts
- Manages fee collection for vesting contract creation
- Maintains registries of locks by owner and recipient
- Supports flexible fee structures and admin controls

### BaseLock

An abstract contract that implements the core locking functionality:
- Stores token, amount, owner, recipient information
- Manages timing parameters (start time, unlock time, cliff period)
- Handles slot-based vesting configurations
- Provides access control and state management

### VestingLock

The implementation contract that extends BaseLock with linear vesting capabilities:
- Supports configurable vesting schedules with any number of slots
- Optional cliff periods before vesting begins
- Linear release of tokens over time
- Withdrawal mechanisms for claiming vested tokens
- Detailed status reporting for vesting progress

## Key Features

1. **Flexible Vesting Schedules**:
   - Configurable number of slots (vesting periods)
   - Optional cliff periods
   - Linear vesting after cliff
   - Support for different ERC20 compatible tokens

2. **Status Reporting**:
   - Detailed vesting progress information
   - Next vesting date calculation
   - Tracking of claimed/claimable/vested amounts

3. **Security Features**:
   - Reentrancy protection
   - Access control for owners and recipients
   - Safe token transfers via OpenZeppelin libraries
   - Prevention of common vulnerabilities

4. **Fee System**:
   - Configurable fee structure
   - Fee collection in standard tokens (e.g., USDC)
   - Admin controls for fee management

5. **Gas Optimization**:
   - Uses proxy pattern for efficient contract deployment
   - Optimized calculations for gas efficiency

## Technical Implementation

- Built with Solidity 0.8.24
- Uses OpenZeppelin contracts for security
- Implements ERC20 token standards
- Uses the minimal proxy pattern for efficient deployment
- Comprehensive testing suite with fuzzing capabilities

## Use Cases

- Token distribution for project teams with vesting periods
- Investor token vesting schedules
- Advisor/partnership token allocations
- Employee token incentives with vesting
- Any scenario requiring controlled release of tokens over time

This system provides a robust, gas-efficient solution for token vesting needs with strong security guarantees and flexible configuration options.
